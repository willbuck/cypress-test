# Cypress Interview Pairing Exercise

This repo contains a basic create-react-app shell that can safely be ignored, the purpose is to have a ready made cypress runner to pair program a Cypress test of https://cars.tmobiletravel.com/, one of our Car Rental partners.

## Prerequisites
You'll need a terminal with yarn or node version 14.8 or higher (tested with 16.10.0)

For help managing multiple node versions on your machine, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Instructions:

1. Clone repo
2. run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `npx cypress open` to open the cypress IDE
4. Finish the implementation of a search form test in `cypress/integration/rocketcars.js`
