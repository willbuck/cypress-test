# Cypress Interview Pairing Exercise

This repo contains a ready made cypress runner to pair program on a Cypress test of https://cars.tmobiletravel.com/, one of our Car Rental partners.

This is not meant to be a high-pressure test, but rather a chance to sample what working together will be like. So we invite you to: 
- :relaxed: Take a deep breath, relax. We enjoy a chance collaborate on something together! 
- :nerd_face: Have the cypress docs or MDN handy if you like, this is open book and meant to be like how we work. Use your resources!
- :speech_balloon: Talk out your thoughts. We want to know how you think about solving problems!
- :question: Ask questions if you're unclear or want help. None of us knows everything and asking each other for help or clarity on objectives helps us deliver a better product :muscle:

## Prerequisites
You'll need a terminal with yarn or node version 14.8 or higher (tested with 16.10.0)

For help managing multiple node versions on your machine, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

You also may want to play around the site and come to the interview with some "user experience" of what it's like to rent a car on our site.

## Instructions:

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `npx cypress open` to open the cypress IDE
4. Navigate to the `cypress/e2e/rocketcars.js` test
5. Follow the instructions in that file to finish the test
